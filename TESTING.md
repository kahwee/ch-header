# Testing ChHeader

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
pnpm test:headers
```

`check` runs the same types, formatting, coverage and build checks as CI.
`pnpm test:fast` runs the focused popup-to-storage-to-rules loop alongside JSON
and action tests. `pnpm test:fast:watch` keeps it running while editing.
`pnpm test:workflows` focuses on JSON round trips, validation, context actions,
Undo and status updates using the real popup template. `pnpm test` watches;
`pnpm test:run` exits. Tests use jsdom and mocked Chrome APIs, so also test Chrome.

## Fast harness

`src/test/popup-harness.ts` mounts the production popup and custom checkbox, with
real controller, storage and background modules. Its Chrome boundary clones stored
values, emits storage events and records dynamic rules. Use `createPopupHarness()`,
`click()` / `input()`, then `await chrome.settle()` before asserting rules. The
settle operation queues Apply after earlier storage events; it needs no polling or
sleep. DOM listeners, globals and module state are cleaned up after each test.

The harness does not validate Chrome's rule schema, measure layout at 744 × 440,
or simulate real network requests. Keep the Chrome matrix below for those checks.

## Real Chrome check — public HTTPS domains

Build and reload `dist/` in Chrome. Import
[https-profile.json](docs/examples/https-profile.json) through the actual toolbar
popup. It starts off and allows only `headers.kahwee.com` and
`headers-peer.kahwee.com`; URL rules target exactly `/headers/match` on each.

Open [the tester](https://headers.kahwee.com) and
[the second site](https://headers-peer.kahwee.com). Run these cases on both:

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Off or denied access | Test header absent; response `original`. |
| On, both test hosts approved | `/headers/match`: `hello-gecko` / `modified`. |
| Excluded path and redirect | `/headers/other` and `/redirect`: absent / `original`. |
| Check second site | Same path boundaries on the other domain. |
| Allow only `headers.kahwee.com` | Primary matching path changes; peer remains unchanged. |
| Restore both domains, edit header name to `Bad Header` on main | Rejected replacement turns profile off; previous headers stop. |
| Restore valid header and enable | Matching path changes again. |
| Revoke all website access | Both sites return to baseline; all profiles off. |

Chrome may close the permission prompt: reopen, select this profile, then enable
it again. Reload both pages after changing access. Failed requests are inconclusive,
not proof that headers were removed. Approve the exact test hosts, never `kahwee.com` or a broad suffix.
`pnpm test:echo:live` checks the deployed Worker responses, privacy headers and
CORS on both domains. It does **not** exercise Chrome or the extension. Unit tests
remain offline; historical results below retain the URLs actually tested.

## Offline Chrome check

Build and reload `dist/` in `chrome://extensions/`. Open the toolbar popup,
click **Import**, and choose [local-profile.json](docs/examples/local-profile.json).
Confirm it starts off. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3002/` and click **Run checks**.

| Case                                     | Expected                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Profile off                              | Document and fetch request headers absent; response `original` |
| `127.0.0.1:3002`, All request types, on  | Document `enabled`; all fetches `enabled` / `modified`         |
| `127.0.0.1:3002/match/*`                 | Only `/match/echo` modified                                    |
| `regex:^http://127\.0\.0\.1:3002/match/` | Only `/match/echo` modified                                    |
| XHR/Fetch                                | Document absent, fetches modified                              |
| Documents                                | Document enabled, fetches unchanged                            |
| Request header unchecked                 | Request absent, matching response modified                     |
| Disable afterward                        | Baseline restored                                              |

Reload the page for document checks. The server always sends `original`; seeing
`modified` proves Chrome changed the response. `curl` does not test the extension.
Stop the fixture with Ctrl+C afterward.

## Interaction checklist

- Right-click an unselected profile: actions affect that profile, not the editor's selection.
- Delete → Undo restores it off. Switch profiles on: only one On badge remains.
- Use Shift+F10, arrows and Escape for the context menu; verify focus restoration.
- Import malformed JSON: inline error, no partial import. Paste/file import: new IDs, off.
- Copy JSON → paste into Import. Download → choose that file. Check one/all export scope
  and sensitive-value masking without changing the stored values.
- Add/delete rows, scroll, search, change color, reopen and reload. Apply by button
  and Enter must not navigate or remove rows. Check Chrome's extension Errors page.

## Verification records

Record new checks here with their date, scope, actual results and limits. Earlier
results are in [the test history](docs/testing-history.md); they are historical
evidence, not proof that the current checkout passes.

### Repository cleanup and Astra setup — September 20, 2026

Added the project GPT-6 Astra default and module/test guidance. Separated dated
verification history from the current acceptance instructions. Removed obsolete
design/QA reports and a run screenshot from tracking, preserving local copies.

Automated: Node 26.7.0 / pnpm 12.4.2 frozen-lockfile install and `pnpm check`
passed: Biome format/lint, TypeScript, 436 extension tests across 26 files with
coverage, five Worker tests, extension ZIP and Storybook build. Local documentation
links, diff whitespace and ignore behavior were checked. Storybook emitted a
dependency deprecation warning for `module.register()` but built successfully.

No extension runtime code changed; actual Chrome checks were not repeated. The
model default applies when Codex loads this trusted project's configuration;
this cleanup does not verify a new Astra session or change an existing session.
