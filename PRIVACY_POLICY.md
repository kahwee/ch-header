# ChHeader Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 28, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 28, 2025

## Overview

ChHeader ("we," "us," "our," or "the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure when you use the ChHeader Chrome extension.

**In short: ChHeader does not collect, use, or share any personal data.**

---

## 1. What Data We Collect

### ‚úÖ What We DO Collect

We do not collect any personal data.

The Extension does not:
- Track your browsing activity
- Collect your IP address or location
- Record which websites you visit
- Gather analytics or usage statistics
- Monitor your typing or input
- Create user profiles

### ‚úÖ What Users Store Locally

ChHeader allows users to **voluntarily create and store** the following data **locally on their computer** through Chrome's encrypted storage:

- **Profile names** (e.g., "Development", "Production")
- **Profile colors and notes** (user-provided metadata)
- **URL matchers** (patterns users specify, e.g., "localhost:3000", "*.example.com")
- **Header names and values** (e.g., "Authorization: Bearer token123")
- **Active profile selection** (which profile is currently enabled)
- **User preferences** (if any are added in future versions)

**Important:** Users create and own this data. It is stored exclusively on their computer in Chrome's encrypted local storage database. The Extension does not access, read, or transmit this data anywhere.

---

## 2. How We Use Data

The Extension uses locally-stored user data **only** to:

1. **Display profiles** in the Extension popup
2. **Generate header rules** that are applied to HTTP requests
3. **Apply header modifications** to websites the user explicitly specified
4. **Save user preferences** between browser sessions
5. **Enable profile import/export** functionality

### No Transmission

User-created data is **never**:
- Sent to external servers
- Shared with third parties
- Used for analytics or marketing
- Stored in the cloud
- Accessed by anyone except the user

---

## 3. Data Sharing

**ChHeader does not share user data with any third parties.**

- ‚ùå No data sent to external servers
- ‚ùå No third-party analytics services
- ‚ùå No advertising networks
- ‚ùå No cloud storage providers
- ‚ùå No marketing platforms
- ‚ùå No other extensions or services

The only party that can access user-stored data is the user themselves through:
- The ChHeader Extension interface
- Chrome's local storage (viewable in DevTools)
- JSON export files (user-initiated)

---

## 4. How Your Data is Protected

### Local Storage Security

- Data is stored in Chrome's encrypted `chrome.storage.local` database
- Encryption is handled by Chrome (user's responsibility to secure their computer)
- Data is never transmitted in plain text
- Data remains on the user's device

### Extension Security

- Built with TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- 121 automated tests ensure correct behavior
- No external dependencies that could introduce vulnerabilities
- Uses Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API (sandboxed, secure)

- No persistent background network connections

### Browser Security

- Chrome's Manifest V3 is the most restrictive extension architecture
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Automatic updates through Chrome Web Store
- Regular security audits by Chrome team

### View Data

---

## 7. Data Retention

### Local Data

- Data persists until the user manually deletes it or uninstalls the Extension
- Users have full control over data retention

### Automatic Deletion
- If Chrome is uninstalled, all Extension data is deleted
